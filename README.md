## Hey!

I feel like I should say something. The frontend was pretty small, so to conserve I didn't use a framework. I built it with RxJS and a virtual dom library called Snabbdom.
I moved the csv's to a postgres database to simulate reality, and because adding lines to a csv with fs or something like that would be ridiculous.
For the charts I used Chart.js.
